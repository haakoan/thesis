Today we do not have a single direct observation of the 
engine powering some of the most luminous events known to humankind.
Our best understanding of core-collapse supernovae comes from 
sophisticated computer simulations.
In this theis we study the gravitational wave signals from state of the art
three-dimensional simulations and investigate what future observations
of such signals can teach us about the death of massive stars.
