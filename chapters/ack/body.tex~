\chapter{Acknowledgements}
The work I have done during my time in Germany would not be possible if not for
my supervisor Ewald M\"uller who gave me the chance to pursue my research interests.
I have learned a lot from Ewald and for that I am grateful. The same can be said for 
Hans-Thomas Janka, who have taught me a lot about core-collapse supernovae.

The help and insights Bernhard M\"uller provided during the process of writing my first paper was invaluable, thank you Bernhard.  

I must also thank Florian Hanke, Tobias Melson, and Alexander Summa. Without their
simulations there would be no date for me to analyse. 

All the members of the stellar group at MPA deserves a sincere thank you. 
The scientific discussion I have had with members of the group has always been
very much appreciated and helpful. My colleagues have in general been more than happy
to lend their expertise and help me solve problems.  

I would also like to thank Michael Kachelrie{\ss} for encouraging me to apply for this PhD position.

The last three years have not been all work and no play, the best memories from M\"unchen 
are those I have shared with the friends I have made here. You are all great. Special mention
should be given to Durand, Andressa, Andy, Isabella, and Dijana. 
The 12.15 lunch group must also be mentioned, present and past members. Lunch has rarely been boring
and I have enjoyed all the good debates.

I also appreciate the continued friendship of the friends I made in Trondheim. Even though we 
are spread all over the world, we still maintain regular contact and I really appreciated it.

Daria, thank you for your support and patience over the last few months. You are truly the best.

Lastly, I would like to thank my family for all the good advice and support they have given,
it has been a great help to me.
