\chapter{Numerical simulations of core-collapse supernovae}
The GW signals presented in this thesis is based on 
supernova simulations that was performed with the code \textsc{Prometheus-Vertex}.
The simulations were performed by members of the Garching-group 
(\citealp{hanke_phd}, \citealp{melson_phd} and \citealp{suma_models}).
In this chapter we described the code used to carry out these simulations and 
we describe the individual models in later chapters. 
\textsc{Prometheus-Vertex} solves the combined problem of hydrodynamics and neutrino radiation transport.
The code has been specifically developed for the core-collapse problem and has been developed for over
decade, the first version was developed in 2002 by \cite{rampp_02} 
\section{\textsc{Prometheus}}
 













\comment The simulations were performed with the \textsc{Prometheus-Vertex} code \citep{rampp_02,buras_06a}. 
The Newtonian hydrodynamics module
\textsc{Prometheus} \citep{mueller_91,fryxell_91} features a dimensionally-split
implementation of the piecewise parabolic method of \cite{colella_84}
in spherical polar coordinates $(r,\theta,\varphi)$. Self-gravity is treated using the monopole
approximation, and the effects of general relativity are accounted for
in an approximate fashion by means of a pseudo-relativistic
effective potential (case~A of \citealt{marek_06}). The neutrino transport
module \textsc{Vertex} \citep{rampp_02} solves the energy-dependent two-moment
equations for three neutrino species ($\nu_e$, $\bar{\nu}_e$, and a species $\nu_X$ representing
all heavy flavor neutrinos) using a variable Eddington factor technique.
The `ray-by-ray-plus'' approximation of \citet{buras_06a} is applied to make the
multi-D transport problem tractable. In the high-density regime, the nuclear equation of  state (EoS) of \citet{lattimer_91} with a bulk incompressibility modulus of nuclear matter of $K=220 \,\mathrm{MeV}$
has been used in all cases.
