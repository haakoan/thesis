\chapter{The effects of rotation}
In this chapter we study the effects rotation have on the GW signal. 
We present three models based on the same progenitor, two rotating models and one non-rotating.
This allows us to study how the signal GW is effected by rotation. 


\section{Supernova Models}
We present the GW signal from three models based on the progenitor of
\cite{heger_05}, which is a solar-metallicity star with a ZAMS mass of $15 \msun$.
The progenitor was developed, taking into account the effects of magnetic fields and rotation,
from ZAMS to the onset of iron-core collapse. The inclusion of magnetic fields lead to an overall
reduction of the final rotation rate of the iron core, compared to a star evolved without magnetic
fields.
